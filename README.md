# 💧 Water Quality Data Analysis & Visualization

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing **water quality parameters** across different regions. Using Python, the notebook performs **data cleaning, outlier detection, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify pollution patterns and assess water quality trends.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Analysis of key parameters: **EC, HCO₃, Cl, SO₄, NO₃, TH, Ca, Mg, Na, K, F**
- **Outlier detection** using IQR method for accurate insights
- **Boxplots and visualizations** comparing parameters across states
- Identification of pollution **trends, anomalies, and high-risk areas**
- Visual storytelling for better understanding of water quality issues
